    <h1>About CollabOS</h1>
        <h2>How CollabOS was started</h2>
            <p>
                Back in mid- to late-2019, Scratcher `elinero` created a forum thread on the Scratch Collaboration Forums, looking to recruit members for a project inspired by OSWars called CollabOS, where people woul sign up to add new features to an OS simulator on Scratch. 
                Membership was relatively low, but soon rose very quickly, with 14 collaborators within the project's official development studio, ranging from `mlcreater` to `Prokube` and `wamu_m`.
                Many more had contributed to the project, but have since left.
            </p>
        <h2>What is CollabOS?</h2>
            <p>
                The CollabOS project is a collaboration between many people on scratch. 
                CollabOS is inspired by OSwars on scratch, but everyone works together. 
                CollabOS itself is an "operating system" on scratch. 
                Some members of the CollabOS project are pushing the limits of scratch, doing things such as creating encrypted chat rooms and cloud systems.
            </p>
